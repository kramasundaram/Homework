## R Markdown
This file has the R code and output for assignment 5.

### Question 1
Utilize yob2016.txt for this question. This file is a series of popular children's names born in the year 2016 in the United States.  It consists of three columns with a first name, a gender, and the amount of children given that name.  However, the data is raw and will need cleaning to make it tidy and usable.


```{r}
### Question a

df <- read.delim("C:\\Users\\KRamasundaram\\Documents\\MSDS 6306\\Home Work\\Assignment 5\\yob2016.txt", header = FALSE, sep =";")
colnames(df) <- c("FirstName", "Gender", "NumberOfChildren")

### Question b

str(df)

### Question c

grep("yyy$", df$FirstName)
df$FirstName[212]

### Question d
y2016 <- df[-212 ,]


```
### Question 2
Utilize yob2015.txt for this question.  This file is similar to yob2016, but contains names, gender, and total children given that name for the year 2015.

```{r}
### Question a

y2015 <- read.delim("C:\\Users\\KRamasundaram\\Documents\\MSDS 6306\\Home Work\\Assignment 5\\yob2015.txt", header = FALSE, sep =",")

colnames(y2015) <- c("FirstName", "Gender", "NumberOfChildren")
str(y2015)

### Question b
#### Obsrevation of last 10 data in year 2015 data set
#### The names start with z. Looks like the names starting with z not popular.

tail(y2015, n = 10L)

### Question c

final <- merge(x=y2016, y=y2015, union("FirstName", "Gender") , all = TRUE)
final$NumberOfChildren.x[is.na(final$NumberOfChildren.x)] <- 0
final$NumberOfChildren.y[is.na(final$NumberOfChildren.y)] <- 0

```
#### Obsrevation of last 10 data in year 2015 data set
The names start with z. Looks like the names starting with z not popular.

### Question 3
a) Create a new column called "Total" in final that adds the amount of children in 2015 and 2016 together.  In those two years combined, how many people were given popular names?
b) Sort the data by Total.  What are the top 10 most popular names?
c) The client is expecting a girl!  Omit boys and give the top 10 most popular girl's names.
d) Write these top 10 girl names and their Totals to a CSV file.  Leave out the other columns entirely.

```{r}
### Question a
colnames(final)[3] = "NumberOfChildren2016"
colnames(final)[4] = "NumberOfChildren2015"
final$total <- final$NumberOfChildren2016 + final$NumberOfChildren2015

####Number of people given popular names
sum(final$total)

### Question b
SortedFinalData <- final[order(-final$total) ,]
####Ten most popular names
SortedFinalData$FirstName[1:10]

### Question c
####Ten topmost popular girl's names
SortedFemaleNames <- subset(SortedFinalData, SortedFinalData$Gender == "F")
SortedFemaleNames$FirstName[1:10]

### Question d
write.csv(SortedFemaleNames[1:10, c(1,5)], "C:\\Users\\KRamasundaram\\Documents\\MSDS 6306\\Home Work\\Assignment 5\\BabyGirlNames.txt", row.names = FALSE)
